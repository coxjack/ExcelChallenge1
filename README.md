# Kickstarter Analysis
Challenge 1 for Butler Data Science

## 1. Overview of project
### 
* There are over 4000 Kickstarter projects in our dataset and our subject's campaign is in theater and more specifically a play. "Theater" is the most prevalent parent category (30% of all projects in dataset) and "Plays" is the most prevalent subcategory (26% of all projects in dataset). 
![Count of Parent Category](https://github.com/coxjack/ExcelChallenge1/blob/main/AdditionalSupportingImages/ParentCategoryTotal.png)

This gives us an opportunity to draw conclusions about the successfulness of campaigns in these subsets. To take it a step further it is now time to look how "Launch Date" and "Goal" determine the successfulness of a campaign.
