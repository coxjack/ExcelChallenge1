# Kickstarter Analysis
Challenge 1 for Butler Data Science

## 1. Overview of project
### 
* There are over 4000 Kickstarter projects in our dataset and our subject's campaign is in theater and more specifically a play. "Theater" is the most prevalent parent category (30% of all projects in dataset) and "Plays" is the most prevalent subcategory (26% of all projects in dataset). 
![Count of Parent Category](https://github.com/coxjack/ExcelChallenge1/blob/main/AdditionalSupportingImages/ParentCategoryTotal.png)
![Count of Subcategory](https://github.com/coxjack/ExcelChallenge1/blob/main/AdditionalSupportingImages/SubcategoryTotal.png)
This gives us an opportunity to draw conclusions about the successfulness of campaigns in these subsets. To take it a step further it is now time to look how "Launch Date" and "Goal" determine the successfulness of a campaign.

## 2. Analysis and Challenges
###
* The two breakdowns of the data we will look at are viewing the different outcomes of theater kickstarters based on their launch dates and viewing the different outcomes of theater kickstarters based on their goal amounts. This will give our subject a good idea on when it best to launch her campaign and for how much to launch it for. While our data only encompasses 9 years of campaigns it is still a good enough time frame for our subject to make a decision.
* I did not face any specific challenges during this analysis but particular challenges that could be faced are a lack of familiarity in excel or a smaller less encompassing dataset.

## 3. Results
###
* May & June are the most successful months to launch a campaign and it continues to drop as the year goes on, until October where is the an uptick in successful and failed campaigns. December is the worst month to launch a campaign as the successful and failed campaigns are almost equal to each other.
